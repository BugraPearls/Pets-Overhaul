2.0 Release! Make sure to check any Changelog to see changes! Adjust your Config to better match your own personal preferences!
Explore new 65+ unique effects from pets and 10+ Town Pet Aura Effects to enrichen your playthrough where the unique effects 'makes sense' with who the pet is, further enhancing pets personality! Pets cover every aspect of the game and every situation there is! Fishing, Mining, Combat, Mobility, Survivability, Harvesting and more!

The mod aims to make all pets have a purpose other than being entirely vanity, feel more 'rewarding' to obtain, have more personality with their effects, worth to grind for and interesting to explore.

New mechanic: Ability Haste. Helping you be able to use your pet's ability faster and more frequently! Usually granted by Supportive Pets to other players.
Town Pets grant you beneficial Auras in a 125/137.5/150 block range! Their effects and range scale up upon entering Hardmode and upon killing Moon Lord!
New Item: Mastery Shard, drops from EoC, WoF and Golem 1 time per world! Combine with any Trophy to craft the bosses Master Mode pet, allowing non-Master mode worlds to obtain limited amounts of Master Mode pets!

The mod follows 3 rules with the effects for our beloved pets:
1. The effect MUST make sense with pets design, it has to have some sort of connection.
2. The effect has to be unique, no 2 pets should have 2 of the almost identical effects, even if its something similiar, it shall serve another purpose or be more effective/less effective on some other area.
3. The effect shall only assist the player, not something that acts as a separate thing. Effects should be more like a 'accessory' (but something more complicated and interesting than regular accessories) rather than a 'minion'.

You can use vanity Pets by: Equipping a pet in the pet slot, but turn its visibility off. Proceed to use whatever pet you want as the vanity pet from your inventory, enjoy!
Remember to have your pet equipped in pet slot to have their effects.
Please report any bugs or imbalances with a pet being way too strong or way too effective compared to other ones at that stage of the game, please report it to our discord or comment about it on the steam page! Open to any sorts of feedback, feel free to join our discord from below!

Key Mechanics
[list]
[*] Pets benefit you in 3 different ways, each is by your Regular, Light and Town Pets!
[*] Usable abilities by your Pets from certain Pets to assist you with your current situation.
[*] A quality system for stats of Light Pets. Essentially making any Light Pet distinct from another one of the same type! One may give higher stats on a X stat, while another may on a Y stat. And one may even give perfect stats in all aspects! All depending on how lucky you are!
[*] Regular Pets gives you unique and interesting buffs for many aspects of the game! You can for example, go full-mana build with the Estee Pet, or give yourself extra survivability in Close Combat while not missing out on Long Range damage with Twins Pet!
[*] Town Pets gives all Players an AoE Buff, in a similar sense of a Campfire in a big radius! These buffs are more on the smaller side, they still will be benefitting you in your own territory, whether it be an utility buff or improving your combat capabilities!
[*] A leveling System with your Junimo Pet for your Harvesting (gathering of Plants, trees etc.), Mining (gathering of ores, finding valuable gems and things like Life Crystals etc.) and Fishing (catching Fishes, doing angler quests and killing Fished up enemies) tasks!
[*] New Mastery Shard item, dropping from select bosses only once per world! (5 in total) Allowing you to craft any Master Mode Pet or Light Pet Crafting item in a non-Master Mode world!

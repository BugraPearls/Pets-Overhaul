[b]2.2 Release!! Complete revamp of code, way more improved systems![/b]
[i]Explore new 65+ unique effects from pets and 10+ unique effects from town pets and slimes to enrichen your playthrough where the unique effects 'makes sense' with who the pet is, further enhancing pets personality! Pets cover every aspect of the game and every situation there is! Fishing, Mining, Combat, Mobility, Survivability, Harvesting and more![/i]

The mod aims to make all pets have a purpose other than being entirely vanity, feel more 'rewarding' to obtain, have more personality with their effects, worth to grind for, effects being interesting to explore, allowing for new, interesting and unique playstyles and improving quality for all parts of the game!

Features and Latest Major Update:
[list]
[*]New Mechanics, such as Ability Haste and Shields, while Haste reduces cooldown of your Pet's abilities and Shield makes you recieve less damage by a flat amount.
[*]New 11 Town Pets and Town Slime's Aura Effects withnin a 125/137.5/150 range, where their effects and range scale up as you enter Hardmode and kill Moon Lord!
[*]Total of 68 new Unique Pet effects where it all is logical with what the pet is that will aid you in all sorts of tasks!
[*]12 Different Pet Class variations!

[*]New Item: Mastery Shard, drops from EoC, WoF and Golem 1 time per world! Combine with any Trophy to craft the bosses Master Mode pet, allowing non-Master mode worlds to obtain limited amounts of Master Mode pets!
[/list]

The mod follows 3 rules with the effects for our beloved pets:
[olist]
[*]The effect MUST make sense with pets design, it has to have some sort of connection.
[*]The effect has to be unique, no 2 pets should have 2 of the almost identical effects, even if its something similiar, it shall serve another purpose or be more effective/less effective on some other area.
[*]The effect shall only assist the player, not something that acts as a separate thing. Effects should be more like a 'accessory' (but something more complicated and interesting than regular accessories) rather than a 'minion'.
[/olist]

You can use vanity Pets by: Equipping a pet in the pet slot, but turn its visibility off. Proceed to use whatever pet you want as the vanity pet from your inventory, enjoy!
Remember to have your pet equipped in pet slot to have their effects.
